## About
Timer is a simple desktop app. It allows you to start a countdown, which can be paused or resumed, at any given time. When the countdown reaches 0, you'll be notified with an alarm.

The app also has a ProgressBar which represents the percentage of the time passed. Surprisingly it was quite a challenge, to make this run properly, in the end I've managed to make it work using BackGroundWorker.

Features I'm hoping to add in the future:
- plugging in your own ringtone.
